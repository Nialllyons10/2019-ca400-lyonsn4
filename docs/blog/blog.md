# MDsmrt Blog

**Niall Lyons**

## Intro
This is a blog which will document the development of my project MDsmrt. I will be using Agile methodologies for this project, and using this [trello board](https://trello.com/b/23TR7Z5V/mdsmrt) to track my tasks.

## 8th October 2018 – Finding a Project Supervisor

I looked at a lot of different topics in the areas which I wanted to work on in this project. I took the opportunity to email a few lecturers to get their opinions on a few things before I made a final decision on what I wanted to do. I drafted up a project proposal for two separate projects in order 
to get feedback on what I should do next. I hope to meet with Prof Andy Way tomorrow to try and finalise the main idea which I have.


## 11th October 2018 – Securing a Project Supervisor

### What has been done 

After meeting with prof Andy way and discussing the concept of the project through emails he has agreed to be my project supervisor. I worked with Andy during my 3rd year project so I am very happy to have his expertise this time around too. I will also be working with Jinhua Du of ADAPT. I have been researching different blockchain technologies including Ethereum and Hyperledger and I have decided that I am going to take the route of Ethereum blockchain as I have a good understanding of the supporting documentation, as it is very in depth. At this stage of I have sent my project proposal to both Andy and Jinhua to see what their thoughts are on it.

### What will be done 

I am going to be preparing for the project proposal meeting which will either be next week or the week after. In the mean time I am focusing on doing more research into blockchain and its architectural structures along with looking over some convolutional neural network work I have done in the past to refresh my brain.

## 24th October - Project Proposal Meeting 

### What has been done

Today I presented my project proposal to Andrew Mc Carren and one other lecturer. It went well and there was no major issues. Both lecturers liked my idea, however they said that it was ambitious, 
but liked the idea of brining blockchain and medical applications together in a decentralised environment. 

### What will be done

What I plan to do next is to begin to develop the first draft of my functional spec and send it to Andy to see what he thinks of it. I will also be working on getting access to the ADAPT GPU cluster 
that Andy has given me permission to use for training my CNN. 

## 2nd November - Blockchain Environment Setup 

### What has been done
I am still in the process of developing the functional spec, and in the mean time I have set up my environment to incorporate IPFS with the blockchain. 

### What will be done 
After getting my environment ready, I will begin to play around with how IPFS interacts with the blockchain and get an understanding of the truffle framework React box.
